eSamizdat book about denationalization and the loss of political capacity in western societies.

This a free book that attempts to find some of the causes behind the recent inability to conduct practical politics in the western democracies. In particular, the bizarre appearance of large communities, throughout the globe, dedicated to preventing the implementation of public health measures during the covid 19 pandemic is taken to be something new in the world that needs to be explained. The historical process of nationalization is considered as a key element for this explanation as national identities are fractured by external forces looking to destabilize powerful nation-states as well as internal forces looking to build a more just society. 

The initial draft (Ver. 0.5, uploaded on July 27, 2024) is only a first pass. Please send comments as pull requests. Harsh criticism is welcome but polite discourse is mandatory.
